# Workflow Composer
The workflow composer automates the process to create a workflow plan for mode-to-model integration.  
The current version exposes one enpoint that consumes an abstract workflow request and model catalog. The composer will 
generate a workflow plan serialized in JSON format. 

This microservice forms part of the SWIM model orchestration pool, for more information view:
